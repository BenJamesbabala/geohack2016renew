Power Plant Locations (U.S.A.)
Power plant locations were sourced from: http://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.php
The columns retained for this study are station id, lat, long, solar_MW, wind_MW and geo_MW and a new column powerplant_MW that lists the maximum MW (Mega-Watt) value of the three and so just shows where there is a powerplant of this type and the MW. 
Population data
From esri templates (included with ArcGIS software) with 1990 census data as point data
Geothermal Proceptivity
From http://www.nrel.gov/gis/data_geothermal.html
This dataset is a qualitative assessment of geothermal potential (Enhanced Geothermal System EGS) for the US based on Levelized Cost of Electricity, with CLASS 1 being most favorable, and CLASS 5 being least favorable. This dataset does not include shallow EGS resources located near hydrothermal sites or USGS assessment of undiscovered hydrothermal resources. The source data for deep EGS includes temperature at depth from 3 to 10 km provided by Southern Methodist University Geothermal Laboratory (Blackwell & Richards, 2009) and analyses (for regions with temperatures equal to or greater than 150Â°C) performed by NREL (2009). CLASS 999 regions have temperatures less than 150Â°C at 10 km depth and were not assessed for deep EGS potential. Temperature at depth data for deep EGS in Alaska and Hawaii not available.

Thermal gradient measurement for the depth interval with corrected temperature and terrain corrections applied. Units are °C/km.
