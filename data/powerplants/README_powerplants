Converting from shp file to displaying in GEE.

1. Read in shp file using Google Earth pro. Right click, save data as, saves as kml file.
2. In your google drive, select new, Google Fusion Table; select kml file; check it looks reasonable; add any meta data; click done.
3. Get ID for fusion table: File, About this table, copy ID
4. Read into GEE: var powerp = ee.FeatureCollection('ft:ID_copied_from_step_3') 
  (you need the ft: at the beginning of this)
5. Display: Map.addLayer(powerp,{},'powerp')
6. If you have a Fusion table that GEE interprets correctly, this should be sufficient. BUT: this particular data does not display properly automatically.
Issues exist with Longitude/Latitude/Geometry. So you need to edit the Fusion table in google drive
7. Open fusion table in google drive: Select fusion table. Edit, change columns. Use the crosses to remove superfluous columns - it looks like ones that have a 'Location' datatype, but aren't Latitude, Longitude or geometry, are confusing GEE: e.g. State and City. Perhaps if it has two different Location points (e.g. geometry vs State), it doesn't know which to plot it at?
8. Reload in GEE, and display.
